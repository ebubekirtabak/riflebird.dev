## Introduction

**Riflebird** is an AI-driven test generation and execution platform — automatically produces unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E), performance, accessibility, and visual tests. Built with self-healing selectors, semantic element targeting, multi-framework execution (Playwright, Cypress, Puppeteer, WebdriverIO), and CI-friendly outputs to integrate easily into your pipelines.

## Features

- **Automated Test Generation**: AI creates tests for you.
- **Self-Healing Selectors**: Tests that adapt to UI changes.
- **Multi-Framework Support**: Works with your favorite tools.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Easy to add to your workflow.
